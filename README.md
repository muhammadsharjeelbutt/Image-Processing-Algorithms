# Image-Processing-Kernels-Visualization
Image processing algorithms+visualizations [Python]

Collection of some techniques in Image processing done in course work for practice and better understanding. Some files may have more than one algorithm. These files are here so you can use them freely (edit however you like). All files were made using Google Colab.

- multiple_algos [template matching (cross correlation, sum of squared distance, normalized cross correlation, hough transform, co-occurence matrix GLCM (contrast, dissimilarity, inverse difference moment, angular second moment, energy, entropy), otsu thresholding ]
- histogram_oriented_gradient (HOG)
- difference_of_gaussian (DOG)
- visualize_gaussian_derivates 3D visuals (first order partial derivative X, first order partial derivative Y, second order partial derivative X, second order partial derivative Y, difference of gaussian kernel σ = 4 - σ = 7)
- visualize_kernels (gaussian kernel size=11x11 σ = 3,gaussian kernel size=11x11 σ = 5, sobel filter, laplacian of gaussian size=3x3, size=7x7)
